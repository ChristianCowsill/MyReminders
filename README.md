# MyReminders

This is a very simple reminder notification app that uses geofence technology.  

The user is able to enter a location and a custom notification they want to receive when they enter the area of the location.  Currently, the app only works for entry into a selected location but ulitmately, it can be modified to allow entrance and exit reminders and also reminders that occur when a user has been inside an area for a period of time.

The custom notifications are saved into SharedPreferences when the user closes the app.
